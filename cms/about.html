<p class="spacer">Iâ€™m currently a third year Ph.D student at <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/ecs/">Durham University</a> exploring applications of parallel processing on the GPU and also a mobile developer for <a href="http://net-a-porter.com">NET-A-PORTER</a>. I'm passionate about tech and love programming. In my spare time I write <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Sync+Apps">apps for Android</a>.</p>
